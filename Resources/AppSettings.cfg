## Virtualization (Wine, Docker, VMs)
# OsintgramCXX allows the execution under various virtualization software, such as Linux under VirtualBox, VirtManager and VMware,
# just to name a few. However, there comes certain limitations. WSL, on the other hand, has almost native support.
# These settings allow execution under certain circumstances. Tweak them, as you'd like.

# - CurrentDirectory: Places them in the current working directory by the CMD/PowerShell

## Autostart Options
# For automatic login, you enable the "AutoLogin" to true, letting a login happen on each startup
# without having to manually type `user-manager` every time.

# which will take in parameters of the command that you run (e.g. `OsintgramCXX example_username`)

## Multi-Lingual Support
