Main features to implement:
[-] Reimplement the Osintgram4j features into C++ (except for JAR-like Modding Support)
[ ] Implement Features from the settings
[ ] Write the documentation for setup and usage
[ ] Implement Instagram APIs (that includes authentication, sadly...)
[ ] Implement Rate Limiting and Wait Timers
[ ] Write a Dockerfile (because we want to avoid that "it works on my machine" bullshit)
[-] Cross-platform support for Windows (not macOS, sorry, I don't have a MacBook, and they isolate too much)
[ ] Implement Configurable Proxies
[ ] Implement Proxy-Chaining Support (default `proxychains.conf`, JSON, CFG, YAML, XML)

Potential features for the future:
[ ] Write a "setup.sh" script that implements vcpkg into the project CMake
[ ] Automate the VCPKG_ROOT, removing the unnecessary CLI arguments
[ ] Implement Multi-Lingual Support

Note: As always, try to make OsintgramCXX as stable as possible. Avoid Software Crashes by using try-catch blocks.
