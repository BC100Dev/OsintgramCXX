Main features to implement:
[-] Reimplement the Osintgram4j features into C++
[?] Write Modding Support, with capability of loading C++ symbol names
[ ] Implement Features from the settings
[ ] Write the documentation for setup and usage
[ ] Implement Instagram APIs (that includes authentication, sadly...)
[-] Implement 2FA authentication capabilities
[ ] Implement Rate Limiting and Wait Timers
[ ] Write a Dockerfile (because we want to avoid that "it works on my machine" bullshit)
[-] Cross-platform support for Windows
[ ] Implement Configurable Proxies
[ ] Implement Proxy-Chaining Support (default `proxychains.conf`, JSON, CFG, YAML, XML)
[ ] Implement DAR (Data Access Restrictions), depending on the Account setup

Potential features for the future:
[ ] Write a "setup.sh" script that implements vcpkg into the project CMake
[ ] Automate the VCPKG_ROOT, removing the unnecessary CLI arguments
[ ] Implement Multi-Lingual Support
[ ] Implement Temporary / Reference Accounts
    > This feature will allow users to log into another account from their main Instagram account

Note: As always, try to make OsintgramCXX as stable as possible. Avoid Software Crashes by using try-catch blocks.

Additional notes:
- Modding Support might get removed either entirely, or not get released with the v1.0 Candidate.
