[ ] Reimplement the Osintgram4j features into C++ (except for JAR-like Modding Support)
[ ] Implement Setting Configurations into the Project, and load them as Shell Environments (read+write from+to file)
[ ] Write the documentation for setup and usage
[ ] Implement Instagram APIs (that includes authentication, sadly...)
[ ] Implement Rate Limiting and Wait Timers
[ ] Write a Dockerfile (because we want to avoid that "it works on my machine" bullshit)
[ ] Cross-platform support for Windows (not macOS, sorry, I don't have a MacBook, and they isolate too much)

Potential features for the future:
[ ] Implement Configurable Proxy / Proxy-Chaining Support
[ ] Write a "setup.sh" script that implements vcpkg into the project CMake
[ ] Automate the VCPKG_ROOT, removing the unnecessary CLI arguments
[ ] Implement Modding Support via Local Network Sockets
[ ] Implement Multi-Lingual Support

Note: As always, try to make OsintgramCXX as stable as possible. Avoid Software Crashes, and please do try-catch blocks.
