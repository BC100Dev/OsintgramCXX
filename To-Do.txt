Legend:
'-' = In Progress
'?' = Unknown State
'X' = Finished
'F' = Finished with caveats (e.g. not every feature was reimplemented due to certain reasons)
'H' = Halted
'R' = Marked for Removal

Main features to implement:
[F] Reimplement the Osintgram4j features into C++
  > yall knw that certain Java features are allergic to C++
[X] Write Modding Support
  > holy f***ing shit, that took me 3-4 hours...
[-] Implement Features from the settings
[ ] Write the documentation for setup and usage
[-] Implement Instagram APIs (that includes authentication, sadly...)
[-] Implement 2FA authentication capabilities
[ ] Implement Rate Limiting and Wait Timers
[ ] Write a Dockerfile (because we want to avoid that "it works on my machine" bullshit)
[-] Cross-platform support for Windows
[-] Implement Configurable Proxies
[ ] Implement Proxy-Chaining Support (default `proxychains.conf`, JSON, YAML, XML)
[ ] Implement Temporary / Reference Accounts
  > This feature will allow users to log into another account from their main Instagram account

Potential features for the future:
[-] Write a "setup.sh" script that implements vcpkg into the project CMake
    > Editors Note: Adapted into "prepare.sh"
[R] Automate the VCPKG_ROOT, removing the unnecessary CLI arguments
[?] Implement Multi-Lingual Support
[ ] Include OpenCV for Image Processing
  > This alone already has issues on Arch Linux with the D-Bus library, when building, therefore, may or may not be implemented.

Note: As always, try to make OsintgramCXX as stable as possible. Avoid Software Crashes by using try-catch blocks.
