DAR (Data Access Restriction) Ability

The account is the main reason that the user might misuse the tool. Therefore, the DAR will kick in place, obfuscating certain things in the way.
For example, the user wants to obtain other's E-Mail Addresses or Phone Numbers:

- +1 888-555-9999 will turn into +1 ***-***-****
- thisisanemail@gmail.com will turn into t**s*s*n*m**l@gmail.com

This may depend on the obfuscator abilities, and how they would be structured.

To lift or reduce the restrictions, the user's main account should:

- Have 2FA enabled (removes 15%)
- Have 2FA via App or Secure SMS like WhatsApp (removes 15% = 30%)
- 2FA SMS should remain disabled (removes 20% = 50%)
- Phone Numbers should not be added to the account (removes 30% = 80%)
- Account must be private (removes 10% = 90%)
- Account's followers count must be above 500 -- account is not seen to be a bot (removes 10% = 100%)
